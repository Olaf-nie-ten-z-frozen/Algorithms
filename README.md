Somewhere in the Pacific, in the middle of absolutely nowhere, there's an Island. It is inhabited by a somewhat primitive tribe of Dotnet. Residents decided to learn how to judge carrots. But because they couldn't, they needed internet tutorials. They also had to order seeds and fertilizers from a store in Europe. But both Youtube and online shopping were out of reach for them. They had neither computers, nor smartphones, nor an optical fiber connection. Actually, they didn't have electricity either, and the nearest store was 3000 km away. So they decided to modernize and digitize the entire island. For this purpose, the village administrator brought in an IT team headed by the programmers Ada and Serweryn.

Upon their arrival, they decided that they would begin by selecting liaison officers from among the members of the villages. They would commission them with minor tasks that would require frequent contacts with an unknown community. The choice was supposed to be the best person according to the criterion chosen by them. Therefore, they asked the village administrator for a list of all inhabitants of individual villages with information about them. Each resident was to be described by:
<li>
<ul>1 - the number of skills</ul>
<ul>2 - height in centimeters</ul>
<ul>3 - average speed expressed in the number of activities performed per hour</ul>
</li>
Then, based on the data from the lists, they wanted to choose the most talented person (1 - has the most skills) or the highest (2 - with the highest height) or the fastest (3 - performs the most activities per hour). It would happen from time to time that in a given village there are several people with the highest value of the required criterion. In such a situation, a person is selected from among them according to the next selected criterion. If there are still more people meeting the two criteria, a person is selected from among them according to the third criterion. For example, for the selected order of criterion 2 3 1, the highest (2) people are searched first, then the fastest (3), and finally the most talented (1).
